# face_recog
face recognition from the photos in the folder
First need to run the code encode.py and then face_recog.py for th ouput.


encode.py gets all the encodings of all the photos in the folder 'faces' and saves in a file named encodings.npy
and face_recog.py reads the readings from the file encodings.npy so it'll be faster.
